# Life Expectancy Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between social determinants of health (SDOH) and life expectancy across U.S. census tracts from 2010 to 2015. The data is sourced from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The goal is to identify correlations between various socioeconomic factors and life expectancy, providing insights into potential public health interventions.The data was cleaned and merged and then exported to tableau to create an interactive dashboard.

## Data Sources
The life expectancy data were sourced from the [CDC](https://archive.cdc.gov/#/details?q=life%20expectancy&start=0&rows=10&url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data-visualization/life-expectancy/index.html).\
The social determinants of health data were sourced from the [Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality](https://www.ahrq.gov/sdoh/data-analytics/sdoh-data.html)\

## Skills Demonstrated
This project showcases proficiency in the following areas:

### Data Wrangling
- Cleaning and standardizing dataset column names.
- Filtering and merging multiple datasets.
- Aggregating data over multiple years.

### Statistical Analysis
- Calculating population-weighted averages.
- Computing correlation coefficients between life expectancy and various SDOH variables.\
